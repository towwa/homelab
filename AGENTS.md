# Codex Agent Instructions

- Use Context7 as the primary source for factual references and code examples when a relevant library or framework exists.
- You can generate code without Context7 when appropriate, but prefer Context7 whenever possible.
- Always resolve the library ID and query Context7 for doc-driven requests.
- If the user doesn't specify a library, ask them to name the package or framework before querying.
